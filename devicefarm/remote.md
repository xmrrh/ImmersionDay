Check the 'Show available ...' checkbox on the device selection screen. This option selects only those devices that can afford to start up within 30 seconds. You can also search for the desired device through the 'Name' field. Select the appropriate device.

Once the request is complete, the session will appear on the screen and you can gesture and swipe as if you were using a real device. Occasionally, operations can be performed via the physical buttons below.
